### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

**SantoshSrivatsan24/SantoshSrivatsan24** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

I am Santosh, a final year undergrad student at BITS-Pilani, Goa. I like learning about new ideas in computer architecture, digital VLSI design, and digital signal processing. 
In my free time I like to read and play chess.
